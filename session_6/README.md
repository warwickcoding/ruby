Recap from Session 5
--------------------
Last session we used hashes and learned about their role as a data structure. We also compared them to arrays and saw how we can use them together if we need to.

We also made a clear distinction between the hash syntax and the Ruby block syntax. It could be confusing at the beginning because they both use `{}`.

We used documentation heavily to learn how to find something we are looking for. It is okay to start with Google sometimes, but I would recommend using the documentation first if you know what your are looking for.


Remembering Methods
-------------------
If we remember from the previous sessions, methods have been used quite a lot. So far, we have been using methods that belong to certain classes provided by the core Ruby language.

Methods are Ruby's functions. Their job is to send a message to another object and this message can perform other functions, collect data or even produce some output. There are so many different thing we can to with a method. The following list contains a few of the methods we have come across so far.

- `to_s`
- `+`
- `==`
- `each`
- `map`
- `select`
- `count`

We can see how methods/functions are an essential part of any language. Luckily for us, the Ruby language is full of great methods that we don't need to write on our own, they are simply shipped with the language.



Creating our own Methods

Let's assume that we want to write a program that will contin
