- [Recap][1]




Recap of Session 1
------------------
In the previous session, we learned how to use Ruby's interactive shell (`irb`). We also learned a bit more about the object-oriented nature of this language. We dived deeper into the different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, symbols, and booleans.

Variables were a big topic as well. We were introduced to capturing input and output into a ruby variables. 
In addition to the above, we learned how to assign a datatype, how to convert from one data type into another one.

Finally, we started using conditional statements with `if` `else` `elsif`.
