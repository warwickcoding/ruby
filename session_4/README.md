Recap of Session 3
------------------
In the previous session, we got introduces to different loops in the Ruby language. We started with `while` loops and demonstrated how they perform. We then moved onto `for`, `upto`, `downto`, and `times` loops. We saw how each of them work and how some of them can be used in lieu of others.
