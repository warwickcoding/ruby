Ruby Course Session 7
=====================

Session Outline:
- Recap
- Classes, a retro
- Built in Classes
- Creating our own Classes
- Modifying existing Classes
- Exercises

Recap from Session 5
--------------------
Last session we used methods and learned how to create our own. We also discussed the benefits of making our methods concise and readable at the same time. Additionally, we compared a few of our own custom methods to loops.

Variables were a big topic in methods! We saw how to deal with multiple known and unknown inputs to our functions.

By this point, you should be feeling much more confident while using the Ruby docs. Don't worry if you still feel confused about the documentation, it takes practice to get to a comfortable point.

Classes, a recap
----------------
We have dealt with a lot of Ruby's core classes in the last 6 sessions. To remind you, here are a few of the main ones:
- String
- Fixnum
- Array
- Hash
- Symbol
- Float
